1) Refactor the File structure (It looks pretty horrid)

2) Design a new way of doing fixtures (It's a bit ass ATM
    Maybe a superclass called Channel, with subclasses of channel types (i.e. Intensity, Colour, Gobo, ...)
    And a fixture is a collection of Channel types??(It makes sense logically))

3) Make tests
